[[Begin|Jail Cell (Unlit) - main]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Jail Cell (Unlit) - main" tags="" position="412,370">You awaken in a dim, cramped jail cell. You have no memory of how you got here.

It&#x27;s small â€” maybe three feet square, and barely twice that high.

You&#x27;re seated on a [[flimsy chair|Jail Cell (Unlit) - examine chair]]. A few subtle rays of light from a [[small window|Jail Cell (Unlit) - examine window]] above catch falling dust particles and shine upon a [[small patch of floor|Jail Cell (Unlit) - examine lit floor]] before you. Beyond that, you can&#x27;t see anything at all.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Jail Cell (Unlit) - examine chair" tags="" position="293,544">What seemed like a chair is actually more of a small semicircle bench with a large hole in the middle. You peer down, but all you see is black.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Jail Cell (Unlit) - examine window" tags="" position="419,546">A small window overlooks the tiny jail cell. A slotted grill is bolted over the opening, allowing a few tentative [[beams of light|Jail Cell (Unlit) - examine window - examine beams of light]] to shine into your cell.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Jail Cell (Unlit) - examine lit floor" tags="" position="546,547">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Jail Cell (Unlit) - examine window - examine beams of light" tags="" position="419,696">Particles of dust dance in the slits of light that shine into the corner of your cell, down the smooth wall and onto the far corner of the floor.

There, at the end of the beam of light, you spot a [[small object|Jail Cell (Unlit) - examine lighter]] glinting slightly in the dimness.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Jail Cell (Unlit) - examine lighter" tags="" position="419,846">You reach down and grasp the small object. Its contours feel familiar to your fingers.
